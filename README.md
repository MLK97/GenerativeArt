# GenerativeArt
Generative Art made with Processing and Processing.py

**Note:** To run the `.pyde` Python Processing scripts you need the Processing IDE with Python mode enabled. [This will get you started](https://py.processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted/). The default installation location of Processing has a dir titled `libraries/site-packages` where any further Python scripts/imports live. Be sure to copy/paste this repo's `libraries/site-packages` files into that dir on your system.
